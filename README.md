# Customer-Churn-Prediction-System
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service. This project aims to predict customer churn in advance, helping businesses take proactive steps to improve customer retention.
The solution is built as an end-to-end machine learning application, deployed using an interactive Streamlit dashboard, making it easy to use even for non-technical users.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses often lose customers without knowing the reason in advance.
By analyzing customer behavior and account information, this project predicts:
1. Whether a customer is likely to churn
2. The probability of churn
3. The key factors influencing the prediction

## 🛠 Tech Stack

1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation & analysis
3. Scikit-learn – Preprocessing & ML pipeline
4. XGBoost – Churn Prediction model
5. Streamlit – Interactive Web Dashboard

## ⚙️ Key Features

1. End-to-end ML pipeline (data preprocessing → model training → deployment)
2. Real-time churn prediction
3. Probability-based results for better decision-making
4. Feature importance for explainable predictions
5. User-friendly dashboard designed for non-technical stakeholders

## 📊 How the Application Works

1. User enters customer details through the dashboard
2. Data is preprocessed using the same encoder and scaler used during training
3. The trained ML model predicts churn risk
4. Results are displayed with:
   1.Churn status (High / Low risk)
   2. Probability score
   3. Explanation of influencing features

## 📈 Results & Insights

1. The model successfully identifies customers at risk of churn
2. Feature importance helps understand why churn risk is high
3. The dashboard bridges the gap between data science and business understanding

## 📌 Future Improvements

1. Add customer retention recommendations
2. Deploy the app online (Streamlit Cloud)
3. Integrate Power BI for historical churn analysis
